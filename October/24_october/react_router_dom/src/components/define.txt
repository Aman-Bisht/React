In this project I have go through the concept of react-router-dom and react-router
Outlet = Provide Layout
NavLink = it have a property of active class
useNavigate = it help to navigate from one component to another
Relative link = which cannot be access using "/" because it inherit the parent property
                or call inside the parent route.
Nested Routed
Index Route = We have to call first child route as default
URL Params :-
useParams = to access the url data like user id;
